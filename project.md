## Project context 

Your group has been hired to provide a solution to temporarily summarize and consolidate the data of the IoT traffic of a multi-national enterprise. The IoT traffic are generated by and collected from IoT devices geographically distributed. The enterprise wants to summarize and consolidate the traffic data in order to detect anomalies and bottlenecks to guide their infrastructure investment decisions. The enterprise’s IT director does not want to invest in a permanent infrastructure to support this tasks, thus the director wants to use a Pubic Cloud infrastructure that covers all geographical locations where the enterprise has a branch.

Each branch generates a comma separated values (CSV) file containing the IoT traffic that you can download at Dataset of legitimate IoT data (VARIoT).

The group’s task is to propose a solution architecture using the AWS services and develop the supporting applications.

The Upload Client uploads IoT traffic generated files by the branches into a shared repository.

The Summarize Worker processes CSV files and summarizes the traffic between the source (Src IP) and destination (Dst IP) devices per day. For each devices combination per day, the application calculates the Total Flow Duration (Flow Duration field) and Total Forward Packet (Tot Fwd Pkt field).

The Consolidator Worker processes the output of the Summarize Worker and update the average and standard deviation of the traffic between the source and destination devices.

The Export Client exports into a CSV file the summarized and consolidated traffic information of a device combination.

### Additional Requirements
The Summarize Worker and Consolidator Workers must be implemented as Lambda functions and as a Java application able to run in a Linux Virtual Machine

The two implementations should be quantitatively compared in terms of performance using all the files in the Dataset of legitimate IoT data (VARIoT).

The solution must guarantee the processing of the files in case of the Workers unavailability or busyness

The solution must use the least amount of Cloud storage resources possible

The Worker must process as soon as possible new IoT traffic files
